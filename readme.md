# DeepFace Face Verification Project

This project is a tool for face verification leveraging DeepFace and Matplotlib libraries in Python 3.10.12.

## Overview

The DeepFace Face Verification Project offers an approach to verify faces using cutting-edge deep learning techniques. It provides a framework to compare and authenticate faces with high accuracy.

## Usage

To get started with the project:

1. Access the Colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yIVXXpzfKn-xOuiuub6GVidzUycMMRdt?usp=sharing).
2. Ensure you have Python 3.10.12 installed on your system.
3. For conda installation, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chronomustard/deepface-verification.git
   cd deepface-verification
   conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt
   conda activate <env_name>
   ```

## Adjusting Sensitivity

Tailor the sensitivity for face verification by fine-tuning the threshold parameter within the code. This flexibility allows you to adapt verification criteria based on specific project needs.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10.12
- DeepFace
- Matplotlib

## Installation with Conda

Use the provided `requirements.txt` file for conda installation:

```bash
