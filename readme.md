# DeepFace Face Verification Project

This project utilizes DeepFace and Matplotlib libraries in Python 3.10.12 for face verification.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you can access the Colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yIVXXpzfKn-xOuiuub6GVidzUycMMRdt?usp=sharing).

### Installation

If you prefer to set up the environment using conda, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. Install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt
    ```

3. Activate the conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate <env_name>
    ```

### Adjusting Sensitivity

You can fine-tune the threshold to match your desired sensitivity for face verification. The threshold can be adjusted within the code based on your specific requirements.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10.12
- DeepFace
- Matplotlib

## Usage

Follow the instructions in the provided Colab notebook to perform face verification using DeepFace. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured as specified above.
